\begin{frame}{Answer set programming}
\begin{myitemize}
    \item \hi{\texttt{eclingo}} is a solver for epistemic logic programs.
    \begin{align*}
        \mathit{felon}   &\leftarrow \K\, \mathit{break\_rule}
        \\
        \mathit{suspect} &\leftarrow \neg \K\, \mathit{break\_rule}, \neg \K \neg \mathit{break\_rule}
    \end{align*}
    This encodes that a person a~$\mathit{felon}$ if we can determine that she broke a rule, and she is a~$\mathit{suspect}$ if it cannot be determined that she has broken nor that she has not done.

    \item Deciding if an epistemic logic program has an answer (called \hi{worldview}) is~$\Sigma^P_3$-complete and~$\Sigma^P_2$-complete for the case of dijuntive\nobreak-free programs.
    
    \item We developed a new version of \texttt{eclingo} that is \speedup{3.3x} faster and solves 87\% more instances.
